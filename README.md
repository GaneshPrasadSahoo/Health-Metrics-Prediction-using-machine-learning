# Health Metrics Prediction using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict key health metrics based on user inputs. The objective is to predict **Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)**, **Stress Level**, and **Heart Rate** using input features like **Gender**, **Age**, **Sleep Duration**, **Physical Activity Level**, **Daily Steps**, and **BMI Category**.

The project includes a **Streamlit** web interface where users can input their details, and the model predicts their health metrics. Various machine learning models, including **RandomForestRegressor**, **DecisionTreeRegressor**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, are trained to make accurate predictions.

Hereâ€™s a screenshot of the web application:

### Sample Output:
- **Blood Pressure**: 135/90 (Hypertension Stage 1)
- **Stress Level**: 6 (Moderate Stress)
- **Heart Rate**: 65 bpm

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `streamlit`
- `matplotlib` (optional for data visualization)

## Conclusion
This project showcases the power of machine learning to predict health metrics based on a variety of inputs. The RandomForestRegressor model performs the best, providing highly accurate predictions. This tool can be used for health monitoring and provides an easy-to-use interface for users to get their health metrics instantly.
